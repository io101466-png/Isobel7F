    <h1>What is Netball</h1>
    <p>Netball is a dynamic, non-contact team sport where two teams of seven players<br>
      work together to move a ball down a rectangular court<br>
      and shoot it through a raised hoop to score goals.<br>
      The main objective is to outscore the opponent. <br>
        <h2> What does a Netball court look like ?</h2>
    A netball court is divided into Three thirds as shown below:<br>
