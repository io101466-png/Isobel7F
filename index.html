    <h1>What is Netball</h1>
    <p>Netball is a dynamic, non-contact team sport where two teams of seven players<br>
      work together to move a ball down a rectangular court<br>
      and shoot it through a raised hoop to score goals.<br>
      The main objective is to outscore the opponent. <br>
        <h2> What does a Netball court look like ?</h2>
    A netball court is divided into Three thirds as shown below:<br>

        <h2>What are the Netball positions?</h2>
        Goal Shooter (GS): The primary scorer, operating only in the attacking goal third, including the shooting circle.<br>
       Goal Attack (GA): Assists in scoring and setting up offensive plays, <br>allowed in the centre and attacking thirds, including the goal circle.<br>
       Wing Attack (WA): A key playmaker responsible for feeding the ball into the shooting circle from the centre and attacking thirds (excluding the circle).<br>
Centre (C): The link between defense and attack, allowed in all three thirds of the court except the goal circles. <br>This player is vital for distributing the ball and restarting play after a goal.<br>
Wing Defence (WD): Primarily defends the opposing Wing Attack in the centre and defensive thirds (excluding the goal circle) to disrupt the opposition's attack.
Goal Defence (GD): Works with the Goal Keeper to prevent the opposing Goal Attack from scoring.<br> This player operates in the centre and defensive thirds, including the goal circle.<br>
Goal Keeper (GK): The last line of defense, restricted to the defensive third and shooting circle,<br> with the main job of stopping the opposing Goal Shooter from scoring. <br>
        
        <h3>Netball Rules</h3>
        Positions and Court Areas Each team has seven players, and each position is restricted to specific areas of the court. Moving outside the designated area is an "offside" infringement.<br>
No Running or Dribbling Players cannot run with the ball. A player who catches the ball must land on one foot (the landing foot) and can pivot on that spot, but cannot take additional steps before passing.<br>
Three-Second Rule A player in possession of the ball has a maximum of three seconds to pass the ball or shoot for a goal.<br>
Contact and Obstruction Netball is a non-contact sport. Players must not physically contact an opponent in a way that interferes with their play. <br>
        Defending players must stand at least three feet (0.9m) away from the player with the ball to avoid an "obstruction" penalty.<br>
Scoring Only the Goal Shooter (GS) and Goal Attack (GA) can shoot, and they must be inside the goal circle to score a goal, which is worth one point.<br>
Centre Pass Play restarts after each goal (and at the start of each quarter) with a centre pass taken from the centre circle, alternating between teams.<br>
Over a Third The ball cannot be thrown over a complete third of the court without being touched or caught by a player.
